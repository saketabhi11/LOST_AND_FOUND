        Welcome to <span className="brand-name">Lost and Found</span> — your trusted online hub for reuniting people with their cherished belongings.
        <br /><br />
        We know the pain of losing something you care about — whether it’s a beloved pet, a precious memento, or a must-have gadget. That’s why we created a space where hope meets help.
        <br /><br />
        Our mission? Simple. To connect finders and seekers in one supportive, people-powered platform. Together, we turn moments of loss into stories of reunion.
        <br /><br />
        Because sometimes, all it takes is one post, one click, or one kind stranger to make things whole again.
